# Shutter Dappnode Package

This package runs a **Shutter Keyper**, as well as its corresponding **Shutter Chain** node, along with a **metrics service** to monitor the node's performance and a **PostgreSQL database** to store the Keyper's state.

### Services

This package includes the following services:

- **Shutter Keyper (`shutter`)**:

  - Shutter provides an MEV protection system for rollups. It prevents frontrunning and improves censorship resistance using a threshold encryption mechanism.

  - There is a supervisor daemon that first ensures all the initialization and configuration processes are completed and then it starts the `chain` process. Once the `chain` process is healthy, the `keyper` is started, too. To do all this, the supervisor runs the scripts contained in `/usr/local/bin`, following this order: `configure.sh` → `run_chain.sh` → `run_keyper.sh`.

  - Configuration files for Shutter are generated and managed in `/keyper/config` and `/chain/config`.

- **PostgreSQL Database (`db`)**:

  - The database stores the state of the Shutter Keyper and is initialized using the `entrypoint.sh` script.

  - Data is persisted in the `db_data` volume, which maps to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

- **Metrics Service (`metrics`)**:

  - Uses VictoriaMetrics to send performance metrics to a remote Pushgateway.

  - Configuration is handled via the config file `/config/gnosis/vmagent.yml`, placehoders in that file are automatically picked up from the environment by vmagent.

### Configuration

The setup wizard provides options for users to configure the package, but all fields except `KEYPER_NAME` are optional because they can be included via a config file that is restored through a backup. This allows users to manage their configuration flexibly, either through the wizard or by restoring pre-configured settings.

### Script Integration

The `dvt_lsd_tools.sh` script is sourced from the `staker-package-scripts` repository. This script is downloaded during the Docker build process using the release version specified in the `STAKER_SCRIPTS_VERSION` argument. Once downloaded, it is placed in `/etc/profile.d/`, where it can be used to manage staking-related processes within the package. In order to use it in the scripts, the profile is sourced (`. /etc/profile`).

### Upstream Repository

The upstream repository is https://github.com/dappnode/DAppNodePackage-shutter.

### Special versions

Branch `shutter_service_gnosis` has an alternative version for running a shutter service keyper on gnosis chain.
